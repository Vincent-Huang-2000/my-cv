MBTI Chat is a full‑stack AI chat web app built around the 16 MBTI personality types. Users can chat 1‑on‑1 with a selected persona, run a group chat with up to 5 personas, or start a structured debate mode (pro/con sides, auto rotation or manual speaker selection, topic analysis and stance generation). On the backend, a dynamic prompt builder composes a stable system prompt from “persona profile + scenario (study/work/emotional, etc.) + personalized settings (profession/mood/zodiac/stage) + conversation context” to keep responses consistent and controllable. The app also includes lightweight analytics (sessions, heartbeat-based retention, and event tracking) to summarize visits, message volume, and persona popularity.
